# THE THEME IS WAVES

- The first thing that come up is a sin function and how that can be used in terms of games.
- I could go for a kind of emotional waves idea but that would be hard to implament and kind of abstract
- Well storylines are repersented in waves.
- The easy idea is some kind of arcade game with waves. That would be easy to implament but the gameplay would be really poor.
    - I could do something like that in UE4 in about 3 minutes. (AND GO)
    - But I have to update UE4 and I'm not going to do that.
- I could do some kind of game based around fluid simulation and preventing tusamsis.
    - Like a RTS where you nuke the water to create attacks.
    - It would be pretty diffacult to implament and I'm concirned the ballence would be diffacult
    - It would also take too much time compared to what's avalible during the weekend.
    - It would look pretty awesome but doing accurate fluid simulation is diffacult.
- Bullet hell shooter is an option.
    - That's basicly just a particle engine but it's not very interesting and the waves don't add a useful mechanic.
- A survival game is possible.
    - Say a big wave happens every x turns and you have to defend agenist it.
    - It could be made in the context of a city building game like SimCity.
    - That would be pretty easy to implament but would still require fluid simulation.
- Another kind of wave is an attacking force.
    - You could make a turn based game like Fire Emblum or Battle for Wesnoth where there's attacks happening every X turns.
    - There's alot of possible gameplay there and you clould also create side quests for the player to preform.
    - So a wave survival game told from the perspective of indervigual charactors.
    - So it would say the next wave is 20 turns away or 10 turns away.
    - Players could fortify the structures based on resource gathering done behind the wall.
    - So it ends up being a kind of simpliyed RTS game with a strong emphsis on defence.
